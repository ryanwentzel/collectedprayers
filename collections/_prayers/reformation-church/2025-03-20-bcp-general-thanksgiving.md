Almighty God, Father of all mercies,  
we, your unworthy servants,  
do give you most humble and hearty thanks  
for all your goodness and loving-kindness to us and to all people.

We bless you for our creation, preservation,  
and all the blessings of this life;  
but above all, for your inestimable love  
in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;  
for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.

And, we beseech you,  
give us that due sense of all your mercies,  
that our hearts may be truly thankful,  
and that we may show forth your praise,  
not only with our lips, but in our lives,  
by giving ourselves up to your service,  
and by walking before you  
in holiness and righteousness all our days;

Through Jesus Christ our Lord,  
to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,  
be all honor and glory, world without end. Amen.
