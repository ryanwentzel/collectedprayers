O God, the abundant source of every good and perfect gift, pour out the cheering light of your sevenfold grace into our hearts. Yes, Spirit of love and gentleness, we humbly ask for your help. You know our faults, our failings, our needs, the dullness of our understanding, the waywardness of our affections, and the perverseness of our will. Visit us with your grace when we neglect to practice what we know. Enlighten our minds and heal our desires. Correct our wanderings and pardon our omissions so that, by your guidance, we may be preserved from making a shipwreck of our faith, keep a good conscience, and, in the end, arrive safely at the haven of eternal rest; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
