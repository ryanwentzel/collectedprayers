O Lord our God, who has chased the slumber from our eyes and once more assembled us to lift up our hands to you and to praise your just judgments, accept our prayers and supplications, and give us faith and love. Bless our coming in and our going out; bless our thoughts, words, and works; and let us begin this day by praising the unspeakable sweetness of your mercy. We pray this through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
