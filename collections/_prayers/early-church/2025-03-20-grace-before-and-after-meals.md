*Before eating:*

Bless, O Lord, your gifts which we are about to receive from your bounty. May your gifts, O Lord, be our refreshment and your grace our consolation, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

*After eating:*

We have been satisfied, O Lord, with your gifts and bounties. Fill us with your mercy, you who are blessed, who with the Father and the Holy Spirit are one God, world without end. Amen.
