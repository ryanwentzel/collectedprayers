O Lord Jesus Christ, you who are the truth incarnate and the teacher of the faithful, let your Spirit overshadow us as we read your Word and conform our thoughts to your revelation, so that, learning from you with honest hearts, we may be rooted and built up in you, who live and reign with the Father and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. Amen.
