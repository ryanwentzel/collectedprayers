O Thou who art King of kings and Lord of lords, we worship Thee.

*"Before  Jehovah's  awful  throne*  
*We bow with sacred joy."*
{: .text-center }

We can truly say that we delight in God. There was a time when we feared Thee, O God, with the fear of bondage. Now we reverence, but we love as much as we reverence. The thought of Thine Omnipresence was once horrible to us. We said ; "Whither shall we flee from His presence ? " and it seemed to make hell itself more dreadful, because we heard a voice, " If I make my bed in hell, behold, Thou art there." But now, O Lord, we desire to find Thee. Our longing is to feel Thy presence, and it is the heaven of heavens that Thou art there. The sick bed is soft when Thou art there. The furnace of affliction grows cool when Thou ajrt there, and the house of prayer when Thou art present is none other than the house of God, and it is 
the very gate of heaven. 

Come near, our Father, come very near to Thy children. Some of us are very weak in body and faint in heart. Soon, O God, lay Thy right hand upon us and say unto us, "Fear not." Peradventure, some of us are alike, and the world is attracting us. Come near to kill the influence of the world with Thy superior power. 

Even to worship may not seem easy to some. The dragon seems to pursue them, and floods out of his mouth wash away their devotion. Give to them great wings as of an eagle, that each one may fly away into the place prepared for him, and rest 
in the presence of God to-day. 

Our Father, come and rest Thy children now. Take the helmet from our brow, remove from us the weight of our heavy armour for awhile, and may we just have peace, perfect peace, and be at rest. Oh ! help us, we pray Thee, now. As Thou hast already washed Thy people in the fountain filled with blood and they are clean, now this morning wash us from defilement in the water. With the basin and with the ewer, O Master, wash our 
feet again. It will greatly refresh ; it will prepare 
us for innermost fellowship with Thyself. So did 
the priests wash ere they went into the holy 
place. 

Lord Jesus, take from us now everything that would hinder the closest communion with God. Any wish or desire that might hamper us in prayer remove, we pray Thee. Any memory of either sorrow or care that might hinder the fixing of our affection wholly on our God, take it away now. What have we to do with idols any more? Thou hast seen and observed us. Thou knowest where the difficulty lies. Help us against it, and may we now come boldly, not into the Holy place alone, but into the Holiest of all, where we should not dare to come if our great Lord had not rent the veil, sprinkled the mercy seat with His own blood, and bidden us enter. 

Now, we have come close up to Thyself, to the light that shineth between the wings of the Cherubim, and we speak with Thee now as a man speaketh with his friends. Our God, we are Thine. Thou art ours. We are now concerned in one business, we are leagued together for one battle. Thy battle is our battle, and our fight is Thine, Help us, we pray Thee. Thou who didst strengthen Michael and his angels to cast out the dragon and  his angels, help poor flesh and blood that to us also the word may be fulfilled : "The Lord shall bruise Satan under your feet, shortly." 

Our Father, we are very weak. Worst of all we are very wicked if left to ourselves, and we soon fall a prey to the enemy. Therefore help us, we confess that sometimes in prayer when we are nearest to Thee at that very time some evil thought comes in, some wicked desire. Oh ! what poor simpletons we are. Lord help us. We feel as if we would now come closer to Thee still, and hide under the shadow of Thy wings. We wish to be lost in God. We pray that Thou mayest live in us, and not we live, but Christ live in us and show Himself in us and through us. 

Lord sanctify us. Oh! that Thy spirit might come and saturate every faculty, subdue every passion, and use every power of our nature for obedience to God. 

Come, Holy Spirit, we do know Thee ; Thou hast often overshadowed us. Come, more fully take possession of us. Standing now as we feel we are right up at the mercy seat our very highest prayer is for perfect holiness, complete consecration, entire cleansing from every evil. Take our heart, our head, our hands, our feet, and use us all for Thee. Lord take our substance, let us not hoard it for ourselves, nor spend it for ourselves. Take our talent, let us not try to educate ourselves that we may have the repute of being wise, but let every gain of mental attainment be still that we may  serve Thee better. 

May every breath be for Thee ; may every minute be spent for Thee. Help us to live while we live and while we are busy in the world as we must be, for we are called to it, may we sanctify the world for Thy service. May we be lumps of salt 
in the midst of society. May our spirit and temper as well as our conversation be heavenly; may there be an influence about us that shall make the world the better before we leave it Lord hear us in this thing. 

And now that we have Thine ear we would pray 
for this poor world in which we live. We 
are often horrified by it. O, Lord, we could 
wish that we did not know anything about it 
for our own comfort. We have said, " Oh ! for a 
lodge in some vast wilderness." We hear of 
oppression and robbery and murder, and men 
seem let loose against each other. Lord, have 
mercy upon this great and wicked city. What is 
to be done with these millions ? What can we do ? 
At least help every child of Thine to doi his 
utmost. May none of us contribute to the evil 
directly or indirectly, but may we contribute to the 
good that is in it.
